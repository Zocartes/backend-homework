## Description

E-Commerce Back End is the back end for an e-commerce site. It uses MySql2 and Sequelize to create a database where Products are held. There are four models (Products, Categories, Tags, ProductTags) with associations between the models along with GET PUT POST and DELETE routes for a business owner to easily update their inventory.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, please run the following commands:

```
npm i express, npm i sequelize, npm i mysql2, npm i dotenv
```

## Usage

Using this application is simple. Once you have all the dependencies installed a user can add any Category Product or Tag to the database. Associations between the models already handled, so the user just needs to enter relevant information around the Products such as price, stock and Tags as well as Category and Tag names. Below is a link to a walkthrough video broken into three parts.
